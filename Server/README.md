In order to run the server, make sure you are using Python 3.3 or greater. 

You will also need to install the Websocket Server module if you don't already have it. Just run `sudo pip3 install websocket-server`

Use the command `python3 Server.py <hostname> <portnumber>` to run the server on localhost (127.0.0.1), listening on port 4444.
